The app is called 'Geocode' which as the name indicates is an app to geo reference locations on to a map.
The app is created using a technology called 'Tethys' which is a python based django framework.

The app has two features enabled to keep it simple and easy to understand. The features are to upload an inp file and to download the geo referenced co-ordinates.

The app helps process the inp files which is an end product of EPANET - a software used to design drinking water systems.

I have added an inp file to this folder just for your reference.
